# Backend of Mux Software Fullstack Intern Assignment

This is the backend (node.js JSON API) for my assignment as part of my application to Mux Software for the role of Fullstack intern.

Feel free to use the code as seen fit.

The project was completed (minimum functionality) one day after due, and deployed to Heroku.

The react app which is used to interact with the API can be viewed [here](https://komefumi.github.io/frontend-of-mux-software-fullstack-intern-assignment/) and the corresponding repository [here](https://github.com/Komefumi/frontend-of-mux-software-fullstack-intern-assignment)
